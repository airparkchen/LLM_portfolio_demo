## Key Projects

### Physiological-Signal-Driven Music Recommendation & EQ Adjustment (Headphone Product)
**Product-oriented research · Pegatron**

- Designed experiment flow (baseline / stimulus / washout) and data structure for sustainable retraining.
- Recommendation approaches: SVD latent factor, user clustering with effect mapping.
- Dynamic EQ: direction / ranking style learning framework (ongoing experiments).
- Music feature analysis + statistical validation (ANOVA, t-test, frequency analysis) to verify hypotheses.
- Collaboration with BSP/DSP teams for device-side integration and data pipeline readiness.

### Android System Development & Compatibility Testing
**AOSP/Framework · XTS (CTS/VTS)**

- Owned XTS workflow execution (CTS/VTS) and issue triage for Android compatibility compliance.
- Framework-level modifications and system-level debugging/performance optimization.

### Robot Reinforcement Learning (Quadruped)
**Isaac Gym · paper reproduction**

- Reproduced RL papers and trained/evaluated policies using Isaac Gym.
- Focused on training workflow, validation, and experiment iteration.

### Cross-Platform App Productization
**Flutter · API integration · firmware collaboration**

- Built product-level cross-platform app (Android/iOS) using Flutter.
- Implemented API integrations and supported firmware-level debugging for end-to-end stability.
